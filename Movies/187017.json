But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.", "Tile1Title": "Runtime", "Tile2Title": "Status", "Tile1SubTitle": "112 Minutes", "Tile2SubTitle": "Released"}
